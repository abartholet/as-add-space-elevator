# Add Space Elevator
AstroSynthesis plugin for adding space elevators

This plugin is available as a right click popmenu option. It adds a 
space elevator (mega structure) to a terrestrial or gas giant body and 
gives it a random population.  A dialogue window will allow you to 
select a minimum and maximum for the random population. 

This plugin also has the option of randomly selecting an image from a 
folder to use as the preview image instead of the default mega structure
 image.  To you this you must edit the AstroScript file and set the 
"sFolder" variable located near the top of the file to the path to the 
folder you wish to use.  Detailed instructions are located in the 
AstroScript file.  If you don't want to use this option just leave the 
AstroScript file as is and it will use the default mega structure 
preview image.
